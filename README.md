# Signup Form

This project is a simple form with some CSS and HTML,to practice some Intermediate level of HTML and CSS. Had some basic validation, styling and a simple button theme changer.

## Features

### Dynamic Theme (Light/Dark Mode):

* Users can toggle between light and dark themes using the "Dark Side" button.
* When the theme is switched, the logo image and text change accordingly to reflect the chosen theme: "New Jedi Order" for light mode and "Sith Order" for dark mode.
* Enhances user experience with a visually appealing and customizable interface.

### Form Validation:

* The signup form includes a simple validation function ensuring all required fields are correctly filled out.
* The stupidVerification() function checks the validity of First Name, Last Name, Email, and Phone Number fields.
* It also ensures that the passwords match. If not, the password fields are reset, and an error message is displayed to inform the user.

### Interactive User Experience:

* Upon clicking the "Submit" button, the form data is validated.
* If all data is correct, an alert window thanks the user for signing up.
* This interactivity makes the form more intuitive and responsive to user actions, improving the overall usability of the site.
